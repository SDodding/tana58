Handwired 58 key wireless split keyboard powered by ZMK

Interesting files:

- What passes for a wiring diagram in /images
- STL files for 3d printing in /stls (There's only the left side, so you'll want to print a mirrored set)
- Freecad files if you wish to modify this for yourself, or for use with other components

I am intending to add a bit more info here to document things a bit better (and add some part numbers)

Firmware for this board can be found [here](https://github.com/SDodding/tana58_zmk/tree/main)
